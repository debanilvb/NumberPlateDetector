The Number Plate Detector App is a software application developed using C++, OpenCV, and Visual Studio. It is designed to detect and recognize number plates in images or video streams.

    **Features**
#Number plate detection: The app uses computer vision techniques provided by OpenCV to identify and locate number plates within an image or video.
#Character recognition: Once the number plate is detected, the app applies optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms to recognize and extract the characters on the plate.

**#** User-friendly interface: The app provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Visual Studio, allowing users to easily interact with the application.
**#** Image and video support: The app can process both static images and real-time video streams, making it versatile for various use cases.

    **Requirements**
**#** C++ Compiler: The app is developed in C++, so you need a C++ compiler to build and run it. Visual Studio is recommended.
**#** OpenCV library: The app relies on the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks. Ensure that you have OpenCV installed on your system.
**#** Visual Studio: To compile and run the app, you need Visual Studio IDE installed on your machine.

    **Installation**
**#** Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
**#** Open the project in Visual Studio.
**#** Configure the project settings to include the OpenCV library. You may need to specify the include directories and library dependencies in the project properties.
**#** Build the project to compile the source code and generate the executable file.
     
      
    **Usage**
**#** Launch the application by running the generated executable file.
**#** The GUI window will appear, providing options to load an image or start a video stream.
**#** If you choose to load an image, click on the "Load Image" button and select the desired image file.
**#** If you want to process a video stream, click on the "Start Video" button. A window will open displaying the video feed from your default camera.
**#** The app will automatically detect number plates in the provided image or video stream and draw bounding boxes around them.
**#** If the number plate is successfully recognized, the extracted characters will be displayed next to the bounding box.
**#** You can save the processed image or video stream with the detected number plates by clicking on the "Save" button.

    **Limitations**
**#** Accuracy: The accuracy of number plate detection and character recognition depends on various factors such as image quality, lighting conditions, and plate variations. It may not work optimally in all scenarios.
**#** Plate Variations: The app may struggle with detecting number plates that deviate significantly from standard formats, have unusual fonts, or are partially obstructed.
**#** Performance: The processing speed of the app may vary depending on the hardware capabilities of your system and the resolution of the input images or video.
