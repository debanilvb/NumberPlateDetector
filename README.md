# Number Plate Detector App

The Number Plate Detector App is a software application developed using C++, OpenCV, and Visual Studio. It is designed to detect and recognize number plates in images or video streams.






## Features

- Number plate detection: The app uses computer vision techniques provided by OpenCV to identify and locate number plates within an image or video.
- Character recognition: Once the number plate is detected, the app applies optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms to recognize and extract the characters on the plate.
-  Image and video support: The app can process both static images and real-time video streams, making it versatile for various use cases.




## Requirements
- C++ Compiler: The app is developed in C++, so you need a C++ compiler to build and run it. Visual Studio is recommended.
- OpenCV library: The app relies on the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks. Ensure that you have OpenCV installed on your system.
- Visual Studio: To compile and run the app, you need Visual Studio IDE installed on your machine.


## Installation

- Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
- Open the project in Visual Studio.
- Configure the project settings to include the OpenCV library. You may need to specify the include directories and library dependencies in the project properties.
- Build the project to compile the source code and generate the executable file.
    
## Run Locally


- Launch the application by running the generated executable file.
- The GUI window will appear, providing options to load an image or start a video stream.
- The app will automatically detect number plates in the provided image or video stream and draw bounding boxes around them.
- If the number plate is successfully recognized, the extracted characters will be displayed next to the bounding box.
- You can save the processed image or video stream with the detected number plates by clicking on the "Save" button.
