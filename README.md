# Number Plate Detector App

The Number Plate Detector App is a software application developed using C++, OpenCV, and Visual Studio. It is designed to detect and recognize number plates in images or video streams.






## Features

- Number plate detection: The app uses computer vision techniques provided by OpenCV to identify and locate number plates within an image or video.
- Character recognition: Once the number plate is detected, the app applies optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms to recognize and extract the characters on the plate.
-  Image and video support: The app can process both static images and real-time video streams, making it versatile for various use cases.




## Requirements
- C++ Compiler: The app is developed in C++, so you need a C++ compiler to build and run it. Visual Studio is recommended.
- OpenCV library: The app relies on the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks. Ensure that you have OpenCV installed on your system.
- Visual Studio: To compile and run the app, you need Visual Studio IDE installed on your machine.


## Installation

- Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
- Open the project in Visual Studio.
- Configure the project settings to include the OpenCV library. You may need to specify the include directories and library dependencies in the project properties.
- Build the project to compile the source code and generate the executable file.
    
## Run Locally


- Launch the application by running the generated executable file.
- The GUI window will appear, providing options to load an image or start a video stream.
- If you choose to load an image, click on the "Load Image" button and select the desired image file.
- If you want to process a video stream, click on the "Start Video" button. A window will open displaying the video feed from your default camera.
- The app will automatically detect number plates in the provided image or video stream and draw bounding boxes around them.
- If the number plate is successfully recognized, the extracted characters will be displayed next to the bounding box.
 You can save the processed image or video stream with the detected number plates by clicking on the "Save" button.
